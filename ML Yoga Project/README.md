### Hey there! Welcome to yogAI, developed in 2021 by Rishi Raj Soni, Devesh Rawat, Aditya Deshwal.
We created yogAI inspired by various Machine Learning models for visual recognition We experimented with during my internship. This is my first Machine Learning model and my first attempt at Web Development. We have loved (almost) every second of this project and We have learnt more than We could have imagined. <br>YogAI uses <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/pose_estimation/overview" target="_blank">Pose.Net</a>, developed by Google’s TensorFlow, and <a href="https://ml5js.org/" target="_blank">ml5.js</a>, a JavaScript library for Machine Learning on the browser. Most of my learning was following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YPSwT06y_AEYTqIwbeam3y" target="_blank">The Coding Train’s</a> YouTube playlist on Pose Estimation.
